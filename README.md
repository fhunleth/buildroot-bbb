buildroot-bbb
=============

Well over a year ago or maybe longer ago, I used to use this repository to build BeagleBone Black
Linux images. Since that time, BBB support was merged upstream, so this is really, really old. Please,
please, don't use this in new projects. If you'd like a more recent buildroot for the BBB and what's
in the upstream buildroot repo doesn't help you enough, you may also be interested in 
https://github.com/fhunleth/bbb-buildroot-fwup. I keep that project around as a simple example of
how I use buildroot. It's not always uptodate, since I don't use it for any real projects, but
it should give you a better idea of what I do.
